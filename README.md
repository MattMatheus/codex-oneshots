# codex-oneshots

Zero human code allowed. Bots only.

This project shares code created entirely by AI.

It is used to test and compare leading AI models on longer, step-by-step work.

## Purpose

This repository stores outputs from various tests of the [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex) AI model.

The goal is to determine whether proper **long-horizon semantic steering** enables fully autonomous agent development activities, where a Codex-powered agent can receive high-level intent and independently plan, implement, and iterate on software without human intervention.

Each "oneshot" in this repo represents a single agent run: the model receives a prompt and is expected to produce a complete, working result with no follow-up guidance.
