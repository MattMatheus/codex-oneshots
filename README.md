# codex-oneshots

Zero human code allowed. Bots only.

## Purpose

This repository stores outputs from various tests of the [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex) AI model.

The goal is to determine whether proper **long-horizon semantic steering** enables fully autonomous agent development activities — i.e., can a Codex-powered agent, given high-level intent over an extended context window, independently plan, write, and iterate on software without human intervention?

Each "oneshot" in this repo represents a single agent run: the model receives a prompt and is expected to produce a complete, working result with no follow-up guidance.
